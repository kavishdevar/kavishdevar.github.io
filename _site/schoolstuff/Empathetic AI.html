							If AI can understand our feelings, they would now know our

						<hr class="m">
						<li class='point'>
							It can also understand one's feeling in a more accurate

							Also it will respond more accurately.
							If It is able to understand Facial Expressions, it would also
							be able understand one's mood, and try to take over the

					es! Why not? Chatbots can convey Empathy & Emotions, and interact with people to solve their problems that require human-like emotions.

						Turning to a chatbot for emotional support might help if a person is feeling depressed/stresed.<br>
						Associate Professor of Communication Jingbo, Meng wanted to see just how effective artificial intelligence chatbots could be in delivering supportive messages.<br>
						She set up the research and used a chatbot development platform to test it out.
						This is what she said:<br>
						<q>Chatbots have been widely applied in customer service through text- or voice-based communication, It’s a natural extension to think about how AI chatbots can play a role in providing empathy after listening to someone’s stories and concerns.</q><br>
						In early 2019, Meng began assessing the effectiveness of empathic chatbots by comparing them with human chat. She had been following the growth of digital healthcare and wellness apps, and saw the phenomenal growth of those related to mental health.
						<img src="https://comartsci.msu.edu/sites/default/files/2021-06/chatbot-flow-graphic.png" ALIGN="left">
						<br>Meng recruited <b>278</b> MSU undergraduates for her study, and asked them to identify major stressors they had experienced in the past month. Participants were then connected through Facebook Messenger with an empathetic chat partner. One group was told they would be talking with a chatbot, another understood they would be talking with a human. Why? Meng wanted to know how did the students react on knowing the reponder, human or chatbot.
						Some chatbots shared their own experiences as way to evoke empathy. Other chatbots simply expounded on their own personal problems at the expense of not validating the participants.
						<br>
						It's always said that everyone don't share their info with everyone. We humans usually prefer to share our feelings with someone who guarantees that information will not be told to anyone and any point of time.
						In this condition the students knew with whom they were sharing their information. The students who shared the information with humans, they felt insecure and thought that whatever they told can be passed to other people also, but the people who were told that they were talking with a chatbot, they told everything free-ly, and got relieved at the end.
						This proved that chatbots are better than human counselors.
