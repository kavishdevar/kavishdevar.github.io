Hi! I'm a student at [DPS84](https://dpsgurugram84.com) (or, at least for now). 

I'm a tech enthusiast and love to code. I'm also a big fan of open source and love to contribute to it. I'm also a big fan of Linux and use it as my daily driver. I also love to tinker with electronics and have a few projects in that domain.
